Assignment 1 was mainly just to setup react native in our laptops with the help of https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup .

The pre requisites for react native are java jdk, android studio and node js.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for node js.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html for java jdk download.

https://developer.android.com/studio for android studio download.
