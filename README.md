# React-native


# Assignment 1

Assignment 1 was mainly just to setup react native in our laptops with the help of https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup .

The pre requisites for react native are java jdk, android studio and node js.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for node js.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html for java jdk download.

https://developer.android.com/studio for android studio download.

# Assignment 3

Create a counter application. Take design inspiration from https://dribbble.com or any other website you prefer. Put the design link in the README along with your app's screenshots. Don't create a basic layout. Try to use the Components discussed any other you read up in the documentation.

My inspiration was https://dribbble.com/shots/7145911-water-counter

App looks like this

# Assignment 4

Create a mobile Banking App UI. You need to use ScrollView, ActivityIndicator and Modal. You can use FlatList if you want. Read the documentation for this one to understand things. Prefer not to watch a video. If you do get issues in understanding the documentation, ask us. We will help you out. An example is something like this- https://dribbble.com/shots/17409666-Investkan-Investment-Bank-Mobile-App/attachments/12536816?mode=media

You don’t need to make multiple pages but the Home/Dashboard one. Same instructions as before, search for UI on dribble, put link and SS in your Readme.
